# AirBn Clone - The Console

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. It involves the development of a command-line interpreter (CLI) for an AirBnB clone.
The command interpreter allows users to manage objects within the AirBnB clone project, such as creating, updating, and deleting instances of various classes.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter, also known as the console, provides a command-line interface for interacting with the AirBnB clone project. Here's how to start and use it:

### How to start the Command Interpreter

1. Clone the Github repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/eodenyire/AirBnB_clone.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd AirBnB_clone

3. Start the  command interpreter by running the 'console.py' script.

python3 console.py

### How to use the command interpreter

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to interact with the AirBnB clone project. Here are some examples of supported commands:

- 'help': Display the list of available commands and their descriptions.
- 'create <class_name>': Create a new instance of the specified class.
- 'show <class_name> <object_id>': Display the string representation of an instance.
- 'update <class_name> <object_id> <attribute_name> "<new_value>"': Update the specified attribute of an instance.
- 'destroy <class_name> <object_id>': Delete an instance.
- 'all <class_name>': Display all instances of a class.

For more information on available commands and their usage, refer to the documentation or  use the 'help' command within the command interpreter.
